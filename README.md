<h1 align="center">Event Tracker</h1>
<h3 align="center">My hiking tracker is a program designed to help me keep track of all the hikes I have been on. It allows me to store information about each hike, such as the trail name, location, length, and elevation gain. With this program, I can easily view all of my hikes in one place and track my progress over time.</h3>

<h3 align="left">Project Take Aways:</h3>
<h3 align="left">Throughout this project, I learned the importance of proper naming conventions for my classes, files, and variables. By taking the time to choose clear and descriptive names, I would have been able to write code that was more readable and understandable from the beginning. This is especially important because when I had to refactor rename my files, it caused errors to my JUnit tests and overall code in many files.
<br>
In addition to improving my naming conventions, this project gave me a deeper understanding of the structure and organization of Spring Data JPA. I found that writing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods was much simpler than in previous projects.</h3>
